# InventoryHUD-F1Fix
A quick and dirty decompile and code fix of the popular Minecraft Mod InventoryHUD+

Fixes the issue where the GUI remains present when in F1 Hide GUI Mode.

## Disclaimer
This mod is not authorised or endorsed by InventoryHUD+'s developer **dmitrylovin**. I was just frustrated that when you hit the F1 key to take screenshots, InventoryHUD remains on the screen. I am not attempting to steal code or replicate the mod in any way,a s the mod is still very actively developed.

Some features *may* be broken, as decompiling is not an exact science, and the original mods code is not publicly available.

If dmitrylovin finds this and requests that I take it down, I will oblige.

No code will be posted here, just the fixed mod files.

***DO NOT contact dmitrylovin in regards to issues experienced with this mod. Open an issue and I will do my best to sort it.***

## Future
This mod will exist until the original mod implements this feature.

Currently based on NeoForge 1.21.1 version 3.4.26.
